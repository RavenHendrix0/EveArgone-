In a disturbing development, the infamous 1C Killer remains on the loose, claiming the life of his third victim, Dr. Daniel Matthew. Dr. Matthew, a highly respected doctor at Northwick Park Hospital in Ladas, tragically met his demise in the early hours of September 1st. Forensic experts estimate that the murder took place around 4:00 a.m., before sunrise.
</br></br>
The reign of terror initiated by the 1C Killer began three days ago with the brutal murder of his first victim, Prof. Ruth Johns, aged 37, on August 28. Merely two days later, Dr. Sean Phelps, aged 54, became the second victim. With the recent killing of Dr. Matthew, the police have confirmed that this serial killer shows no signs of stopping.
</br></br>
Dubbed the "1C Killer" or the "One Coin Killer," this perpetrator earned his nicknames due to the distinctive mark left at each crime scene - a Wenland's pound coin. The presence of this coin, along with the shared method of killing, is the only apparent link between the three cases. It is noteworthy that despite working in different hospitals, all the victims share a connection through their involvement in the medical field.
</br></br>
As the investigation unfolds, law enforcement agencies are working tirelessly to apprehend the 1C Killer and end the wave of violence gripping the community. The public is urged to exercise vigilance and report any information that may assist in capturing this dangerous individual.
